Lab 3: Evil Hangman : 
---------------------

###Description
-----

In Evil Hangman, the program shall make it extremely hard for the user to guess correct letters,
as it will constantly change the word based on which letters the user guesses. This is done through
the organization of word families, which sort words based on the placement of certain letters. 

The program, though secretly evil, is unusually friendly and supportive, giving the illusion that
it really wants the user to win (although it is totally conspiring against the user) 


###Usage
-----
Run the program though ps3.py, it is mandatory that a list of words is in the same folder under the name "words.txt"
Run the runner program from a command line by CDing into the project directory and executing:
`python ps3.py`
